### About this project...

This was my 4th year integrated masters project titled: "Spatially Resolved Reflectance Spectroscopy for Investigating Photon Migration and Depth Sensitivity in Turbid Media", in layman's terms I studied how light interacts within translucent materials. I looked at Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM) to quantify the differences and similarities between inks and pigments, fibre optic reflectance spectroscopy to study how light diffuses through a material and made a Monte Carlo simulation in python to gather data to compare with those experimental measurements.
